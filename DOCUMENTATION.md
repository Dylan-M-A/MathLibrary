## Vector 2
Vector 2 takes the x and y values of a two dimensional object and can either add, subtract, multiply, or divide. It can also be normalized and use a formula called magnitude to help it.
It also has dot product which get two x's or y's and multiplies them together before adding them.

## Vector 3
Vector 3 is very similar to Vector 2, but it includes a third value of z. This method is used for third dimesional objects. It also introduces cross product which has a three by two rectangle of numbers and cross multiplies them to get an answer.

## Vector 4
Vector 4 uses the same functions as Vector 3 while extending the values to 4 different numbers by using w.

## Matrix 3
Matrix 3 is a math function that has number inside of a matrix. It's a three by three square of numbers that can by added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided. You can also creat rotation and scale by using Cos and Sin values.

## Matrix 4
Matrix 4 can do the same thing as Matrix 3 but with a 4 by 4 square of numbers. It can rotate on a x, y, and z axis now. It is used for 3D use cases.

## Transform 2D
Transform 2D takes uses from previous classes like Vector 2 and Matrix 3 to create local and global values. Some examples are Matrix 3 being used for local rotation or Vector 2 being used for local position.
